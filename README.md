# User Information App - AJAX Server

Website with a form on it that acts like a search bar. When someone types into the search bar, it retrieves a list of matching users and lists them by name on the same page. Whenever the user's input changes in the search bar it will trigger an Ajax request to the server.

Autocomplete
The form is modified so that every time the user enters a key, it makes an AJAX call that populates the search results.

Bandwidth optimization
The form is modified again so that AJAX requests happen at most once every 300 milliseconds.
